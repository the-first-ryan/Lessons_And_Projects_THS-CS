/** Project 1 skeleton code.
 *  Definition: Proj1.java is a console-based, menu-driven program that contains
 *  many useful and fun methods to modify a user's text. After prompting the 
 *  user to input a line of text, Proj1.java provides the user with options to 
 *  change the text, perform a find and replace, transform the text through a
 *  random choice of three modifiers, view statistics about the text, or to exit
 *  the program. The program continues, providing the user with the menu after
 *  their selection completes, until the user chooses to exit the program from
 *  the menu.
